Just walked out of the theater after watching Opus (who even names a film Opus these days?) and my brain's still kind of reeling. I mean, it's like someone dumped a bucket of colors into my head and said, Figure this out. The whole thing’s a mess—in a good way, maybe. Or like a bad dream you half enjoyed. Ha.

First off, the visuals are on drugs. Seriously. Whoever was in charge of the cinematography, give them a medal or a restraining order, I'm not sure which. Colors hit you like a slap from an angry rainbow, and there was this one scene… was that a llama riding a unicycle? Might've been the caffeine, I dunno. But I swear that scene had no business being there, yet felt like it was home. It’s the sort of craziness you see when you're sleep-deprived and halfway through a bag of stale popcorn.

>No joke, though, the plot. Hooo-boy. Ever tried reading a bedtime story while someone's blasting heavy metal in the background? That’s the vibe here. The storyline weaves in and out like it’s late for its own dance recital. At one point, I forgot who the villain was. Maybe there wasn’t one? Or maybe I turned into one just by sitting through it all. Quite possible.

The acting. It’s, um, expressive? Nah, more like facial yoga. They churned out emotions like they’d lost the remote, and everything's stuck on fast-forward. There's this one character who’s supposed to be all mysterious and brooding but looks like he’s trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle with psychic powers. Or gas. One or the other. But hey, at least the soundtrack’s a banger. I might just download the movie for those tracks—it’s like heartbeat anthems for the plot-dead.

Look, just go watch the movie. It’s one of those where you have to experience it to believe it – or disbelieve, whatever. It’ll either wreck your worldview or leave you wondering why art majors get paid. I came out of the theater feeling like I’d been sprinting uphill in flip-flops, and yet, a tiny part of me is annoyed because, in all its chaotic glory, it kinda made me feel something. Anything. Ugh.
